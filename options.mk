# DEFAULT DEVSTACK OPTIONS
# Included into Makefile and exported to command environment.
# Defaults are listed in this file.
# Local git-ignored overrides can be configured by creating `options.local.mk`.

# WHEN ADDING NEW OPTIONS TO THIS FILE:
# * Provide an explanation of what the option is for.
# * Explain what values it can be overriden to.
# * Set the default value with `?=` to allow.
#   This prevents us from clobbering the value if it is already defined,
#   allowing overrides to be passed in via the command line.

# Folder in which we looks for repositories.
# Defaults to parent of this repository.
